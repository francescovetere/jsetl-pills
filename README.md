# jsetl-pills
This repo contains the material used in my seminary for the course "Programming paradigms and languages" of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at University of Parma.

It contains a brief introduction on logic programming, with some examples in Prolog and Java, focusing in particular on the benefits of using the Java [JSetL](http://www.clpset.unipr.it/jsetl/) library.
